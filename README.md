# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project: 
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.
We helped Steve to advise his parents on which stocks to invest on based on the historical performance of each stock.
## Results: 
### Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
In 2017 most of the stocks were perfoming well and all had good returns it was until 2018 when some of the stocks were performing well while other were losing. It was only EHPN and RUN that had positive returns the rest were losing and some such as DQ and JKS were losing more than 60%. His parents were interested in DQ but based on the data it shows that is not a good stock to invest on.
We also wrote a refactored code that performs faster than the original code and is able to provide steve with the analysis of all stocks in less than 0.1 second.
## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
While using the refactoring code the code runs faster as it just goes through the loop once and stores all necessary variables. the code is a bit more complicated and needs extra attention to write it as correct as possible.
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
There are special ways to specify array variables in VBA and specific errors in case something goes wrong. If we know how to overcome the challenges of specifying those variables and using them we can benefit from a way faster code that will help run through our data and provide us with faster repsponse.
